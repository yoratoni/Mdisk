File Format
-----------
Byte order is little endian and the character encoding seems to be ISO-8859-1.
A value of 0xFFFFFFFF for any field denoting an index is a "null pointer". E.g.
the root directory has a parent directory index of 0xFFFFFFFF. (It might actually
be a signed 32bit integer and the value is -1.)
